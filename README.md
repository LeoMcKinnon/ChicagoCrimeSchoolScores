## Overview

This repository hosts the data, analysis scripts, visualizations, and the full academic paper that investigates the relationship between high-impact crimes and academic performance in Chicago. The study examines whether neighborhoods with higher rates of crimes—specifically homicide, narcotics offenses, offenses involving children, robbery, and weapons violations—also suffer from lower educational outcomes, and how economic deprivation may amplify this relationship.

## Introduction

Urban environments face a complex interplay between public safety and educational quality. Prior research (e.g., Laurito et al., 2019; McCoy et al., 2013) has shown that exposure to violent crime can harm student well-being and achievement. Extending this work, studies such as Boxer, Drawve, and Caplan (2020) have demonstrated that geospatial patterns of crime are strong predictors of variations in school performance.

This paper focuses on high-impact crimes in Chicago and employs a geospatial approach—integrating data from the Chicago Police Department, Chicago Public Schools, and the U.S. Census Bureau—to explore:
- How crime clusters around schools may disrupt the learning environment.
- The extent to which economic challenges in high-crime neighborhoods contribute to poor academic performance.

## Data & Methodology

### Data Sources
- **Chicago Police Department:** Crime records for high-impact offenses.
- **Chicago Public Schools:** Metrics of academic performance.
- **U.S. Census Bureau:** Socioeconomic indicators, including poverty and unemployment rates.

### Analytical Approach
- **Geospatial Analysis:** Heatmaps and spatial clustering techniques were used to visualize and assess the overlap between crime hotspots and areas of educational disadvantage.
- **Statistical Correlation:** The study quantitatively examined the relationships between crime rates, economic hardship, and academic outcomes, highlighting proportional shifts in neighborhood conditions.

---

## Key Findings

- **Spatial Clustering of Crime:** Neighborhoods with elevated weapons violations and other high-impact crimes show significantly lower student performance.
- **Economic Hardship Correlation:** Areas with high concentrations of narcotics offenses, robbery, and weapons violations also face higher levels of poverty and unemployment.
- **Interconnected Challenges:** The analysis indicates that crime, economic deprivation, and poor academic outcomes are mutually reinforcing, suggesting that even modest improvements in one area could yield benefits in the others.
- **Policy Implications:** Effective interventions should be holistic—addressing public safety, economic inequality, and educational support simultaneously—to break the cycle of disadvantage.

---

## Conclusion

The findings of this study underscore that crime is not only a public safety issue but also an economic challenge that deepens educational disparities. By revealing the cyclical relationship between high-impact crime, economic hardship, and lower academic performance, the paper calls for integrated urban policies that:
- Enhance community investment in education and vocational training.
- Improve school safety.
- Foster economic revitalization in disadvantaged neighborhoods.

Such coordinated interventions are crucial for fostering long-term economic resilience and social stability in Chicago.
